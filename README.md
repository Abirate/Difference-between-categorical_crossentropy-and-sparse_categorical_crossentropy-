# Difference-between-categorical_crossentropy-and-sparse_categorical_crossentropy-
I do a series of treatments on image files,(+checking the CNN model: compiling it with different parameters values to show the difference between the two values of loss parameter :

'sparse_categorical_crossentropy' and 'categorical_crossentropy'

This demonstration doesn't use the image generators(you will understand why if you follow the 3 different steps)
